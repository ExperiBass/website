        I have the right to decline any commissions. They can be denied for multiple reasons, Mainly if I don't feel
        comfortable doing it or
        if I feel I can't give you the best for what you're paying.
    </p>
    <p>If I approve your commission, I will do a rough watermarked Sketch and send you a preview. I will require Payment
        in full at this point via PayPal.
        Any changes to outline will need to be made now or I will charge USD$1 extra for each major outline change
        afterwards.
        During the works, I will send you a few updates as well to keep communication going.
        I do not do free art so please don't ask. If you're going to be mean, also please don't ask. I will also need
        time to do the art due to multiple ongoing medical issues so feel free to ask how its coming but please be
        patient.
